# question
When drawing a meter-like widget in Processing 2.2.1, I create a series of tick marks, which are the segments of lines radiating from the center of the dial.

When I render the dial in the default java environment, there are some very slight anaomlies.  If you view the image ![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)https://github.com/mikeboich/question/blob/master/meter.png you can see at tick number 149 that is isn't quite aligned with its neighbors.  If I render in javascript, everything is perfect.  Is this a problem in the underlying java graphics?
